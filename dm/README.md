**"Some player in this team has visited India, and all players in this team have visited either India or Sri Lanka."**

#### Step 1: Identify the Domains

- **Domain 1 (D1)**: Set of players in the team.
- **Domain 2 (D2)**: Set of countries (India and Sri Lanka).

#### Step 2: Define the Predicates

- \( P(x) \): \( x \) is a player in the team.
- \( V(x, y) \): Player \( x \) has visited country \( y \).

Where:
- \( x \) refers to a player (from **Domain 1**).
- \( y \) refers to a country (from **Domain 2**), such as **India** or **Sri Lanka**.

#### Step 3: Logical Expression

Now let's break down the **two parts** of the sentence and combine them into one logical statement:

1. **"Some player in this team has visited India."**
   - This is an **existential quantifier** because we're saying **at least one player** visited India.
   - The logical expression will be:  
     **\( \exists x \, (P(x) \wedge V(x, \text{India})) \)**

2. **"All players in this team have visited either India or Sri Lanka."**
   - This part uses a **universal quantifier** because it applies to **every player**.
   - The logical expression will be:  
     **\( \forall x \, (P(x) \rightarrow (V(x, \text{India}) \vee V(x, \text{Sri Lanka}))) \)**

#### Step 4: Combine the Expressions

Now, we combine the two parts using a logical **AND** (\( \wedge \)) because both conditions must be true:

- **\( \exists x \, (P(x) \wedge V(x, \text{India})) \wedge \forall x \, (P(x) \rightarrow (V(x, \text{India}) \vee V(x, \text{Sri Lanka}))) \)**

This means:
- **There exists at least one player \( x \)** in the team who has visited India, **and** 
- **For all players \( x \)** in the team, if \( x \) is a player, then they must have visited either India or Sri Lanka.

---

### Recap:
- **Domains**:
  1. Players (Domain 1)
  2. Countries (Domain 2)

- **Predicates**:
  - \( P(x) \): \( x \) is a player in the team.
  - \( V(x, y) \): Player \( x \) has visited country \( y \).

- **Logical Expression**:
  - **\( \exists x \, (P(x) \wedge V(x, \text{India})) \wedge \forall x \, (P(x) \rightarrow (V(x, \text{India}) \vee V(x, \text{Sri Lanka}))) \)**

This represents the sentence: "Some player in this team has visited India, and all players in this team have visited either India or Sri Lanka."
