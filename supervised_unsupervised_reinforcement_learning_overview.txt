Supervised Learning: The algorithm learns from labeled data (input-output pairs) to make predictions. It's used for tasks like classification (e.g., spam detection) and regression (e.g., house price prediction).

Unsupervised Learning: The algorithm finds patterns in unlabeled data without predefined outcomes. It's used for clustering (e.g., customer segmentation) and anomaly detection (e.g., fraud detection).

Reinforcement Learning: The model learns by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback through rewards or penalties. It's used in applications like robotics, gaming, and autonomous driving.

Each type of learning is suited to different tasks and data types.
